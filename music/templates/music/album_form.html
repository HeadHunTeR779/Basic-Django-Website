<!-- This is for the input form for adding new albums from the user's site ; Now we didn't include this in AlbumCreate as template_name
in views because YOU DONT NEED TO the file name 'album_form' is very specific all those models whose input data is taken using
generic.edit.CreateView must have the input form HTML file's name as (Model name)_form where Model_name is the name of the model in
LOWERCASE!!! -->

<!-- remember that {% include %} those parts which will be LESS frequently used and {% extends %} those which are like the generic
template for all pages like the background and the title bar
also the {% block %}     is IGNORED In {% include %} so be careful!! -->
